    1. ex : `driver.implicitly_wait(10)`

        - single statement
        - performance will not be reduced (if element is available within the time, it proceed to execute next statement)
    - disadvantage :
        - if the element is not available within the time mentioned, still there is a chance of getting exception
2. **explicit wait**
    1. works based on condition
    - advantage :

    - disadvantage :
        - multiple places
        - feel some difficulty

### time.sleep(time in seconds)
