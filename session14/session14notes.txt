openpyxl → we can work with excel files (.xlsx)

1. Read data from excel
2. How to write data into excel
3. data driven test case

File → Workbook → Sheets → Rows → Cells

Read data :

data = sheet.cell(r, c).value

Write data :

sheet.cell(r, c).value = “value”

workbook.save(file) # save the file after entering the data
